 @class YKFKeyRawCommandService
 
 @abstract
    Provides a low level interface to communicate with the YubiKey.
 
 @discussion
    This service provides a low level interface to execute requests agaist the key when other specialized
    services (e.g U2F, OATH etc.) may not be used. While this interface allows for low level interactions
    with the key, it's recommended to use specialized services when available (e.g. if the intention
    is to use U2F, it's better to use the U2F Service provided by the library).
 
    The Raw Command service is mantained by the key session which controls its lifecycle. The application
    must not create one. It has to use only the single shared instance from YKFAccessorySession and sync its
    usage with the session state.
